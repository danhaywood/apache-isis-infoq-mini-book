[[__basics_persons-name]]
== ``Person``'s name [link:https://github.com/danhaywood/gymclass/tree/_2.1-Person-first-name-and-last-name[2.1^]]


Let's start out by making `Person` a little bit more realistic.
Currently the entity only defines a "name" property, let's change that.

I did the following:

* renamed `name` property to `firstName`
* added in a new `lastName` property
* tweaked the `.layout.xml` for the new `lastName` property
* updated fixture data (in `PersonData`) to provide realistic names for people
* updated the supporting domain services (`PersonMenu` and `PersonRepository`) to be able to create and find ``Person``s with both a first- and last name
* changed the `updateName()` action to update both first and last names, and removed some dummy validation that came from the the simpleapp archetype
* updated unit and integration tests
* removed the BDD spec tests completely

For now at least I've left the `notes` property (which came from the archetype) as it is.

xref:__basics_persons-name_person-object[] shows this updated version of `Person`.

Let's explore a few of the changes in a little more detail.


[[__basics_properties]]
== Properties

The new `lastName` property is almost identical to the (renamed) `firstName` property:

[source,java]
----
@javax.jdo.annotations.Column(allowsNull = "false", length = 40)
@Property()                                         // <1>
@Getter @Setter
@Title(sequence = "1")                              // <2>
private String firstName;

@javax.jdo.annotations.Column(allowsNull = "false", length = 40)
@Property()                                         // <1>
@Getter @Setter
@Title(sequence = "2", prepend = " ")               // <2>
private String lastName;
----
<1> Provides additional metadata (if any) about the property to the framework
<2> The `@Title` annotation describes how to build the title (for the user to distinguish the domain object in the UI).
Discussed further xref:__basics_persons-name_title[below].

If you look at the running application then you'll see that the properties are read-only; they can only be modified using the `updateName()` action.
Why is this?

One of the attributes of the `@Property` annotation is "editing", the default of which is:

[source,java]
----
@Property(editing=Editing.AS_CONFIGURED)
----

If you search for a file called `isis.properties`, you'll find that the archetype provides two such files, one in the `gymclass-application` module and another in the `gymclass-webapp` module.

The idea is that the former (in the `application` module) is immutable, storing "policy" decisions that are not expected to change.
The latter (in the `webapp` module) holds configuration properties that will change, eg DB connection strings when running in dev, test or prod.

The `Editing.AS_CONFIGURED` value means to use the value of the `isis.objects.editing` configuration property.
As you'll discover, this is set to "false" in `isis.properties` file, which is why editing is disabled for these two properties.

On the other hand, if you take a look at the `notes property, you'll see:

[source,java]
----
@Property(editing = Editing.ENABLED)
private String notes;
----

So here the property can be edited, overriding the global default.
The viewer renders this as a little pencil mark in the bottom-right of the field, as shown in xref:__basics_persons-name_editable-property[]

[#__basics_persons-name_editable-property,reftext='{figure-caption} {counter:refnum}.']
.Icon indicating a property is editable.
image::ch02/editable-property.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danhaywood/apache-isis-infoq-mini-book/master/src/docs/asciidoc/imagesch02/editable-property.png"]

If you want to allow the end-user to update multiple properties at the same time (such as the ``Person``'s first- and last names), then you'll need to use an action; see xref:__basics_persons-name_updateName[below].

If only one property needs to be changed, then you have a choice: you could either make that property editable, or you could provide an action.
Which you choose is to some degree a matter of style/taste, even so my recommendation is to use property edits only for minor/insignificant modifications to state where there is no business logic.
Actions on the other hand should indicate something significant from a business perspective.

In our gym case study, I could imagine that a gym member might want to renew their membership.
Even if this only changes a single property of the domain object (such as a "paid up until" date), I would still model it as an action because it the term "renew" will have significance to the end user.


[[__basics_title]]
== Updated title

The title of an object is provided to allow the end-user to distinguish the domain object in the UI.
It most prominently appears in the top of the web page displaying the object.
Later on we'll see it is also used in hyperlinks representing references between objects.

There are several different ways to build up a title.
Using `@Title` is declarative and suitable if the title does not change with the state of the object.
An alternative imperative approach is to write a `title()` method.
For example, we could have:

[source,java]
----
public String title() {
    return getFirstName() + " " + getLastName();
}
----

Obviously if the title varied by state of the object, then this method could get more complex, with `if` statements and so on.

If no properties are annotated with `@Title`, and if there is no `title()` method, then the framework falls back to use `toString()`.



.Use getters to access state
****
I just want to call out the importance of using getters to access state, even within the domain object itself.

You need to remember that the object's state is retrieved transparently by the ORM (DataNucleus), and some state may be retrieved lazily; generally it depends on the type.

If you access an instance variable directly rather than through its getter, you run the risk that the ORM may not have rehydrated that state.

Broadly speaking, primitives and strings (corresponding to columns of the underlying table) will be loaded eagerly, while references to other objects (which would otherwise require a SQL JOIN) will be loaded lazily.

This behaviour can be tweaked using the `javax.jdo.annotations.Persistent` annotation; search for documentation on "fetch groups".
****



[[__basics_updateName]]
== The `updateName()` action

Let's take a look at the updated `updateName()` action:

[source,java]
----
@Action(semantics = SemanticsOf.IDEMPOTENT)
public Person updateName(
        @Parameter(maxLength = 40)
        @ParameterLayout(named = "First name")  // <1>
        final String firstName,
        @Parameter(maxLength = 40)
        @ParameterLayout(named = "Last name")   // <1>
        final String lastName) {
    setFirstName(firstName);
    setLastName(lastName);
    return this;
}
public String default0UpdateName() {            // <2>
    return getFirstName();
}
public String default1UpdateName() {            // <2>
    return getLastName();
}
----
<1> Provides a UI hint for the 0^th^ and 1^st^ parameters respectively
<2> Provides a default value for the 0^th^ and 1^st^ parameters respectively



And as xref:__basics_persons-name_person-updateName[] shows, if we invoke the `updateName()` action then the defaults for its parameters are correctly populated.

[#__basics_persons-name_person-updateName,reftext='{figure-caption} {counter:refnum}.']
.Updated `Person` with first and last names.
image::ch02/Person-updateName-prompt-with-defaults.png[pdfwidth="60%",link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danhaywood/apache-isis-infoq-mini-book/master/src/docs/asciidoc/imagesch02/Person-updateName-prompt-with-defaults.png"]



[[__basics_layout]]
== A look at the layout

In xref:__basics_persons-name_person-object[] you can see that I positioned the `lastName` property under the `firstName` property, with the `updateName` action under both.
This positioning comes from the `Person.layout.xml` file. specifically this:

[source,xml]
----
<c:fieldSet name="Name">
    <c:action id="delete"/>
    <c:property id="firstName"/>
    <c:property id="lastName">
        <c:action id="updateName"/>
    </c:property>
</c:fieldSet>
----

The layout also moves the `notes` property over to the right-hand side; check out the use of `<col>` elements for this purpose.

Also, earlier on we noted that the xref:__basics_persons-name_title[title] of a domain object is rendered at the top of the page.
In fact that was a slight simplification; actually it appears wherever the `<domainObject/>` element appears in the layout file:

[source,xml]
----
<bs3:row>
    <bs3:col span="12" unreferencedActions="true">
        <c:domainObject bookmarking="AS_ROOT"/>
    </bs3:col>
</bs3:row>
----


One of the principles of Apache Isis is that it will always generate a UI representation of the domain objects.

So what happens if you forget to reference a property, collection or action of the domain object?

If you look elsewhere in the `layout.xml` you'll see that exactly one section has an attribute of `unreferencedActions`, `unreferencedProperties` or `unreferencedCollections`: the layout is considered invalid if it does not include this.
As you've probably figured out, any class members that are not referenced elsewhere will be rendered in these sections.

For example, in `Person.layout.xml` you'll see that I've added:

[source,xml]
----
<bs3:tab name="Other">
    <bs3:row>
        <bs3:col span="12">
            <c:fieldSet name="Other" unreferencedProperties="true"/>
        </bs3:col>
    </bs3:row>
</bs3:tab>
----

This means that, if I were to add a new property to `Person` and forget to update `Person.layout.xml`, then it'll appear in a new "Other" tab.


And what happens if there's no supporting `layout.xml` file at all?
Well, in this case the framework will fallback to reading the various `@...Layout` annotations (and `@MemberOrder` and `@MemberGroupLayout`) of the class itself.
And if there are no such annotations, it will use defaults baked into the framework:  properties listed alphabetically on the left-hand side, and collections listed on the right, actions at the top.


[[__basics_queries]]
== Updated queries

Prior to adding the "lastName" property we had the `PersonMenu` domain service providing an action to search for `Person` instances by way of the `PersonRepository`.
In adding the "lastName" property I decided to generalize this so that searching for a person by name meant matching to use either first name _or_ the last name.
This required a change to the query's definition, found on the `Person` class:

[source,java]
----
@javax.jdo.annotations.Queries({
        @javax.jdo.annotations.Query(
                name = "findByName",
                value = "SELECT "
                        + "FROM domainapp.modules.persons.dom.impl.Person "
                        + "WHERE firstName.indexOf(:name) >= 0 "
                        + "   || lastName.indexOf(:name) >= 0 "),
        ...
})
...
public class Person ... { ... }
----

This query is written in JDOQL.
Note that SQL functions (such as a substring match, here) tend to be written using a Java-like syntax.

I also required an exact match on both first name and last name, so I updated the `PersonRepository` domain service with a new finder:

[source,java]
----
public class PersonRepository {
    ...
    public Person findByFirstNameAndLastName(String firstName, String lastName) {
        return repositoryService.uniqueMatch(
                new QueryDefault<>(
                        Person.class,
                        "findByFirstNameAndLastName",
                        "firstName", firstName,
                        "lastName", lastName));
    }
    ...
}
----

This also required a new JDOQL query defined on `Person`:

[source,java]
----
@javax.jdo.annotations.Queries({
        ...
        @javax.jdo.annotations.Query(
                name = "findByFirstNameAndLastName",
                value = "SELECT "
                        + "FROM domainapp.modules.persons.dom.impl.Person "
                        + "WHERE firstName == :firstName "
                        + "   && lastName == :lastName ")
})
...
public class Person ... { ... }
----

JDO provides several link:http://www.datanucleus.org/products/datanucleus/jdo/query.html#jpql[different ways of writing queries], at various levels of abstraction and power: type-safe queries, criteria API, JDOQL and direct SQL.
Or, there are third-party options such as link:http://www.querydsl.com/[QueryDSL].
However, in this case study I'm going to stick with JDOQL.



== Unit tests

Domain objects in Apache Isis are just pojos, so they can be easily tested using unit tests.
Here's

[***TODO***]

* nested static
* naming (via mavenmixins, Test$Xxx)

[source,java]
----
public class Person_Test {

    Person person;

    @Before
    public void setUp() throws Exception {
        person = new Person("Billy", "Mason");
    }

    public static class FirstName extends Person_Test {

        @Test
        public void happyCase() throws Exception {
            // given
            assertThat(person.getFirstName()).isEqualTo("Billy");
            assertThat(person.getLastName()).isEqualTo("Mason");

            // when
            String name = "William";
            person.setFirstName(name);

            // then
            assertThat(person.getFirstName()).isEqualTo(name);
        }
    }
}
----


== Integration tests

and fixtures...


[***TODO***]

* nested static
* naming (via mavenmixins, IntegTest$Xxx)
** can mix and match with unit tests
* injected


[source,java]
----
public static class UpdateName extends Person_IntegTest {

    @Test
    public void can_be_updated_directly() throws Exception {

        // when
        wrap(person).updateName("new first name", "new last name");
        transactionService.nextTransaction();

        // then
        assertThat(wrap(person).getFirstName()).isEqualTo("new first name");
        assertThat(wrap(person).getLastName()).isEqualTo("new last name");
    }

}
----


[source,java]
----
public class Person_IntegTest extends PersonsModuleIntegTestAbstract {

    @Inject
    FixtureScripts fixtureScripts;
    @Inject
    PersonRepository personRepository;
    @Inject
    TransactionService transactionService;

    Person person;

    @Before
    public void setUp() throws Exception {
        // given
        fixtureScripts.runFixtureScript(new PersonsModuleTearDown(), null);
        CreatePersons fs = new CreatePersons().setNumber(1);
        fixtureScripts.runFixtureScript(fs, null);
        transactionService.nextTransaction();

        person = PersonData.FREDA_MCLINTOCK.findWith(personRepository);

        assertThat(person).isNotNull();
    }

----

The `PersonsModuleIntegTestAbstract` superclass does the bootstrapping.
It's mostly boilerplate and pretty boring so we'll ignore this for now.
Suffice to say it allows us to test the `persons` module by itself.



[source,java]
----
@Accessors(chain = true)
public class CreatePersons extends FixtureScript {

    /**
     * The number of objects to create, up to 10; optional, defaults to 3.
     */
    @Nullable
    @Getter @Setter
    private Integer number;

    /**
     * The objects created by this fixture (output).
     */
    @Getter
    private final List<Person> people = Lists.newArrayList();

    @Override
    protected void execute(final ExecutionContext ec) {

        int max = PersonData.values().length;

        // defaults
        final int number = defaultParam("number", ec, 3);

        // validate
        if(number < 0 || number > max) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(String.format("number must be in range [0,%d)", max));
        }

        // execute
        for (int i = 0; i < number; i++) {
            final PersonData data = PersonData.values()[i];
            final Person person =  data.createWith(wrap(personMenu));
            ec.addResult(this, person);
            people.add(person);
        }
    }

    @javax.inject.Inject
    PersonMenu personMenu;

}

----


[source,java]
----
@AllArgsConstructor
public enum PersonData {

    FREDA_MCLINTOCK("Freda", "McLintock"),
    BARRY_BLACK("Barry", "Black"),
    SEBASTIAN_SMITH("Sebastian", "Smith"),
    FIONA_BAGGINS("Fiona", "Baggins"),
    HARRY_SLATER("Harry", "Slater");

    private final String firstName;
    private final String lastName;

    public Person createWith(final PersonMenu menu) {
        return menu.create(firstName, lastName);
    }

    public Person findWith(final PersonRepository personRepository) {
        return personRepository.findByFirstNameAndLastName(firstName, lastName);
    }
}

== Object identity (link:https://github.com/danhaywood/gymclass/tree/_2.2-exception-recognizer-for-Person-duplicates[2.2^])

For every entity you'll need to think about its identity: how is it uniquely distinguished from other instances of the same type?

So far as the database is concerned, JDO allows the identity (primary key) to be assigned either automatically (by the ORM) as a surrogate identifier, or it can be assigned explicitly by the application.
The first of these options - using a surrogate identifier - is reasonable in most cases.

This then leads to a further decision: which strategy the ORM should use to actually generate the surrogate id?
Most RDBMS provide some built-in mechanism for this, so we can use another JDO annotation to select this as appropriate.

While a surrogate identifier is useful within the database, it doesn't have any meaning to the end-user.
We therefore also need to determine which set of properties of the domain object provide  its identity from a business perspective.

In many (though not all) cases this will be the same as the xref:__basics_persons-name_title[title] of the object.
However, a title needs only be "unique enough" to allow the user identify the domain object in the UI (and it may in fact have additional supplementary information, eg the status of an object).
The business identity of the object on the other hand must be genuinely unique in the database too.

In the case study, when I added `lastName` to the `Person` entity, I decided to make it part of the object identity.
That involved updating the JDO annotations, and updating the implementation of `Comparable`:

[source,java]
----
@javax.jdo.annotations.PersistenceCapable(
        identityType=IdentityType.DATASTORE,                                    // <1>
        schema = "persons"
)
@javax.jdo.annotations.DatastoreIdentity(
        strategy=javax.jdo.annotations.IdGeneratorStrategy.IDENTITY,            // <2>
        column="id")
...
@javax.jdo.annotations.Unique(
    name="Person_lastName_firstName_UNQ", members = {"lastName", "firstName"}   // <3>
)
public class Person implements Comparable<Person> {
    ...
    public int compareTo(final Person other) {
        return ObjectContracts.compare(this, other, "lastName", "firstName");   // <4>
    }
}
----
<1> Indicates that an ORM-managed surrogate identifier will be used...
<2> ...with the values assigned by the database ("identity" strategy)
<3> Defines the business key uniqueness
<4> Corresponding implementation of `Comparable<T>` interface

It's best practice for the domain object to implement `Comparable`, and this should be consistent with the uniqueness constraint.
The `ObjectContracts` class you see here is provided as a utility class as part of the Apache Isis applib (the library that contains all the annotations and so forth).
As you might imagine, this will compare the objects by last name and then first name.

[TIP]
====
Implementing `Comparable` also means that when we start to associate collections of objects with each other then we'll be able to use `Set<T>` as the collection type, and the order of the objects in the table will be "obvious" to the end-user (ie the natural ordering of the entity type).
====


As things stand it's unlikely that this design will suffice: what happens when we get two people with the same name, for example?
If I try to create a such a duplicate user, I get the message shown in xref:__basics_persons-name_person-duplicate[].


[#__basics_persons-name_person-duplicate,reftext='{figure-caption} {counter:refnum}.']
.Updated `Person` with first and last names.
image::ch02/attempt-to-create-duplicate-Person.png[pdfwidth="30%",link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danhaywood/apache-isis-infoq-mini-book/master/src/docs/asciidoc/imagesch02/attempt-to-create-duplicate-Person.png"]

That's not the most user-friendly error message, but we can at least start the conversation by demonstrating the issue to the domain expert.
We can then decide together what's the right way forward.
Probably I'd suggest a surrogate identifier (a membership number or similar); if that made sense then there might also be a discussion about how that identifier is allocated (just a number, or some other scheme).

We can also improve the error message.
Apache Isis has a whole bunch of plugin points: optional SPI (service provider) interfaces that can optionally be implemented.
One of these is the `ExceptionRecognizer2` interface.
Any time an exception is thrown by the application (whether in the persistence layer or domain layer) any implementation(s) of this SPI are consulted to see if the exception's message can be converted into something less cryptic for the end-user.

For example, here's an implementation of `ExceptionRecognizer2` for `Person`:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN)                     // <1>
public static class UniqueConstraintViolationRecognizer
                        implements ExceptionRecognizer2 {           // <2>
    ...
    public String recognize(final Throwable ex) {
        final String message = ex.getMessage();
        if(message != null && message.contains("Person_lastName_firstName_UNQ")) {
            return "A Person with that (first and last) name already exists";
        }
        return null;
    }
    public Recognition recognize2(final Throwable ex) {
        final String reason = recognize(ex);
        return reason != null
                ? new Recognition(Category.CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION, reason)
                : null;
    }
}
----
<1> automatically picked up as a service by Classpath scanning
<2> implements the SPI service

With this implementation added to our application, as xref:attempt-to-create-duplicate-Person-exception-recognizer[] shows the error message generated is much more friendly.

[#attempt-to-create-duplicate-Person-exception-recognizer,reftext='{figure-caption} {counter:refnum}.']
.Updated `Person` with first and last names.

All that said, this is only a demo app, so I'm not going to overcomplicate things with a surrogate membership number etc., but will just press on.



== Paraname8 addon (link:https://github.com/danhaywood/gymclass/tree/_2.3-paraname8[2.3^])

The Apache Isis framework tries to infer as much of the structure of the domain objects directly from Java code.
For example, properties are inferred by the presence of getters returning a scalar, and collections are getters returning a collection.
Actions are remaining `public` methods.
Annotations are typically used for metadata that cannot be inferred in this way.

If we look at the `updateName(...)` action we see that the parameter names have the `@ParameterLayout` annotation:

[source,java]
----
public Person updateName(
        @Parameter(maxLength = 40)
        @ParameterLayout(named = "First name")
        final String firstName,
        @Parameter(maxLength = 40)
        @ParameterLayout(named = "Last name")
        final String lastName) {
    ...
}
----

Java's reflection API (that Apache Isis uses heavily) was only extended to allow the parameter name to be inferred as of Java 8.
Since the version of Apache Isis that we're using still supports Java 7, we need the `@ParameterLayout`.

Instead, we can bump up the app to run under Java 8, and we use the http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-metamodel-paraname8[Isis addons' paraname8] metamodel extension.
The README for that module explains how to configure it; the key requirement is adding this line:

[source,ini]
----
isis.reflector.facets.include=\
        org.isisaddons.metamodel.paraname8.NamedFacetOnParameterParaname8Factory
----

to the `isis.properties` file, which "teaches" the framework to use the updated Java 8 reflection API.

With these changes made we can get rid of `@ParameterLayout` everywhere, reducing some boilerplate:

[source,java]
----
public Person updateName(
