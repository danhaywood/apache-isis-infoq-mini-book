Apache Isis (TM) is a full-stack framework for building enterprise applications.
It's also great for building the REST services for internet-scale apps, be they microservices or the backend of a mobile app.

In this mini-book we'll learn about the framework through an example application that demonstrates both these main use cases (as an enterprise app and as a mobile backend).
Along the way we'll take a few diversions to describe some of the background and philosophy of why the framework is as it is: as you'll see, it's quite opinionated!

But for now, let's get on with the show.

== Introducing the Case Study

In an effort to get a bit fitter I recently joined a gym, and I really enjoy attending their various classes (spinning and barbells, yeah!).
One can book a class up to seven days in advance, and there's limited number of places for each class so they'll put you on the waiting list if it is already fun.
But to book a class you need to phone up the gym; there's no website nor mobile app.
So this is what gave me the idea for the case study we're going to use in this mini-book.

xref:_getting-started_introducing-the-case-study_diagram[] shows a UML class diagram for the main entities that make up our domain.

.Case study

We have five main entities, which I've arranged into four different modules:

* the `employees` module holds the `Instructor` entity; this represents the individual who takes the class

* the `classes` module defines both the `GymClassDescription` entity and the `GymClass` entity.
An example of the first might be "Pilates @ 5pm each Wednesday, usually run by Tamsin".
An example of the second might be "Pilates on 1st March 2017, run instead by Bobbi"

* the `customers` module defines the `Customer` entity; these are the punters who pay the gym cash

* finally the `attendance` module defines the `GymClassParticipant`.
That's a `GymMember` attending one of the ``GymClass``es.

I've used link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Modeling_in_Color[Coad Colors] to indicate the nature of the various classes; I learnt this technique a long time ago and I still find it useful occasionally.

.Exploring the domain together
****
One of Apache Isis' strengths is in being able to tackle complex business domains, where neither the techies in the team nor even the busines experts start off with a complete understanding of the domain.
Building an Apache Isis application is then a journey for the entire team, as insights and deeper concepts are uncovered along the way.

So it's actually not that realistic to start off building an app, as we are doing here, with a full domain class diagram already mapped out .
Trying to simulate that journey of discovery would just make this mini-book too long, though.

[[_getting-started_introducing-the-case-study_case-study-repo]]
=== The Case Study Repo

To prevent this mini-book just being listing after listing, I'm not going to exhaustively spell out all the source code that makes up the application.
Instead, I'll highlight the new concepts as they arise, and then I'll use tags in the link:https://github.com/danhaywood/gymclass[`danhaywood/gymclass`] repo (up on github) that houses the source code.

This means that you can (A) check out the code at any point, and (b) you can use github's link:https://github.com/danhaywood/gymclass/compare[github's /compare view] to inspect the differences between any two tagss.

Still, if you want to follow along, you will need to install some software.
Next section looks at the prerequisites.

[[_getting-started_prereqs]]
== Prereqs

Apache Isis is a Java framework, and we build with Maven.
You'll therefore need to install:

* link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html[JDK 8]. +
+
Actually, Apache Isis 1.x also supports Java 7, but some of the addons/customisations we'll be using require Java 8.

* link:https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven 3.3.x] or higher

You'll also need an IDE.
I was an link:https://www.eclipse.org/[Eclipse (TM)] user for over a decade, and still have fond memories of that IDE, but I switched to link:https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download[IntelliJ (TM)] (community edition) a few years ago.

You'll find setup instructions for both these IDEs on the link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/dg.html#_dg_ide[Apache Isis website].
If you're an Apache NetBeans (TM) user then I'm sure you'll have no problems also; the main requirement is good Maven support.


[[_getting-started_using-the-maven-archetype-to-generate-the-app]]
== Using the maven archetype to generate the app

Apache Isis provides the link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/ugfun.html#_ugfun_getting-started_simpleapp-archetype["SimpleApp" Maven archetype] to get you started.
So that's what I'll use.

In a suitable directory:

[source,bash]
----
mvn archetype:generate  \
    -D archetypeGroupId=org.apache.isis.archetype \
    -D archetypeArtifactId=simpleapp-archetype \
    -D archetypeVersion=1.14.0 \
    -D groupId=com.danhaywood.apps \
    -D artifactId=gymclass \
    -D version=1.0-SNAPSHOT \
    -B

cd gymclass
----

which I then push to my link:https://github.com/danhaywood/gymclass[`danhaywood/gymclass`] repo that I created on github:

[source,bash]
----
git init
git add .
git commit -m "adds files generated by simpleapp archetype 1.14.0 ..."
git remote add origin https://github.com/danhaywood/gymclass.git
git push -u origin master
----


And I'll tag that immediately:

[source,bash]
----
git tag 0.0.1 && git push origin 0.0.1
----


[[_getting-started_running-the-app]]
== Running the app

Even though we've not made any changes, you might want to try out the app at this point.
To pull down the code at this point, use:

[source,bash]
----
git checkout 0.0.1
mvn clean install
----

You can then run using:

[source,bash]
----
mvn -pl webapp jetty:run
----

You can also load this module into your IDE.
Again, you'll find instructions on the Apache Isis website on how to do this, for link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/dg.html#_dg_ide_intellij_importing-maven-modules[IntelliJ], and for link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/dg.html#_dg_ide_eclipse_importing-the-project[Eclipse]


[TIP]
====
If you go to the github website you'll also be able to inspect the repo at this point by choosing the appropriate tag, as shown in xref:_getting-started_running-the-app_github-tag[].

[#_getting-started_running-the-app_github-tag,reftext='{figure-caption} {counter:refnum}.']
.Select tag from the github website
image::ch01/github-tag.png[]

If you look at the "README" at this point you'll see that the maven archetype lists a whole bunch of ways to build the app and then run it.
From the command line using `jetty:run` is probably most convenient, but you'll also see that you can even build and run the app as a Docker image!
====

Navigate to link:http://localhost:8080[localhost:8080] to open up the index page, as shown in
xref:_getting-started_running-the-app_index-page[].

[#_getting-started_running-the-app_index-page,reftext='{figure-caption} {counter:refnum}.']
.Index page for the app generated by simpleapp archetype
image::ch01/simpleapp-index.png[link="images/ch01/simpleapp-index.png"]

The index page for the app shows two links: "wicket/" and "swagger-ui/".
Clicking on the "wicket/" link will take you to to a login page, where you can use `sven`/`pass` as a default user and password.

From there you are at the home page and you can create, find and update ``SimpleObject``s, as shown in xref:_getting-started_running-the-app_object[].

[#_getting-started_running-the-app_object,reftext='{figure-caption} {counter:refnum}.']
.A "Simple object"
image::ch01/simpleapp-object.png[link="images/ch01/simpleapp-object.png"]


.Fixtures
****
By default the application is configured to run against an in-memory database (HSQLDB).
That means that each time you run up the application, you'll have to start anew.

Obviously, that would get pretty tiresome pretty quickly, so to save yourself some time you can run up a fixture, as shown in xref:_getting-started_running-the-app_fixtures[].

[#_getting-started_running-the-app_fixtures,reftext='{figure-caption} {counter:refnum}.']
.Run fixtures to set up the app into a known state
image::ch01/simpleapp-run-fixtures.png[link="images/ch01/simpleapp-run-fixtures.png"]

Later on [***TODO***] we'll see that fixtures are also used within Apache Isis' support for writing integration tests.
****


== Refactor 

The archetype gives us a single module called "simple", with a single domain class called "SimpleObject".
That class in turn has a single property called "name".

As it happens, the structure of that module is quite similar to the `Instructor` entity in the `employees` module, so I'm going to do some renaming:
